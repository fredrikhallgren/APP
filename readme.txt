\f0\fs24 \cf0 AirPumpPir - Control your air pump or air conditioner with an arduino, PIR motion sensors and DHT22 temperature sensor\
\
An air pump and air conditioner are most efficient when at high fan speed.  I was however disturbed by the noise this gives so when I enter the room I would like the fan speed to decrease and after I leave the room the fan speed could go high again. It is a two step process, first you read the data from you remote and save the raw signal. You then enter this in the other code for run time.}
